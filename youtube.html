                  <h2 class="card-title">Negative Effects on Viewers</h2>
                  <p class="card-text">Along with many positive influences on society listed below, YouTube has faced criticism over aspects of its operations, including:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Handling of copyrighted content contained within uploaded videos</li>
                    <li>Recommendation algorithms perpetuating videos that promote conspiracy theories and falsehoods</li>
                    <li>hosting videos ostensibly targeting children but containing violent and/or sexually suggestive content involving popular characters</li>
                    <li>Videos of minors attracting pedophilic activities in their comment sections</li>
                    <li>Fluctuating policies on the types of content that is eligible to be monetized with advertising</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="card-text">All bad aside, it is believed that an overall balance is positive and YouTube continues to improve many areas in societies, some of which are outlined below.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Proliferation of Knowledge</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="card-text">YouTube enables inexpensive creation and distribution of educational content, as well as "how to" videos created by individual YouTubers.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Worldwide video access has spurred innovation by enabling geographically distributed individuals to build upon each other's work and to collaborate.</p> 
            <p class="card-text">One of the most important implications of enabling easier access to quality teaching materials and educators, is the opportunity to learn potentially life-changing skills, such as programming, completely free of charge.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Collaboration and Crowdsourcing</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="card-text">In projects such as the YouTube Symphony Orchestra and The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers, geographically distributed artists were selected based on their individual online video auditions and assembled on the same stage to perform, respectively, at Carnegie Hall (2009) and at the Academy Awards ceremonies (2010).</p>
            <p class="card-text">The existence of YouTube enabled some truly incredible situations to occur, like a homeless person joining a legendary American rock band Journey, after being found by the original band members on YouTube, performing a cover of their song.

            <h2 class="card-title">Alternative Ways of Making a Living</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="card-text">Enabling a new way of earning a livelihood, YouTube's "Partner Program" started in 2007 and by January 2012 grew to about 30,000 partners.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Top five hundred partners earn more than $100,000 annually each, and some earn considerably more.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Many popular brands were reported in 2012 to pay six figures direct to the most popular YouTubers to create and upload ads</p>
             <p class="card-text">What once restricted to popular individuals being able to afford an air time in traditional media, is now available to anyone with basic video equipment, creating tremendous opportunities for disadvantaged societies around the world.</p>
