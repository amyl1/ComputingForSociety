        <p>Facebook, Inc. is an American online social media and social networking service company based in Menlo Park, California. It was founded by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. It is considered one of the Big Four technology companies along with Amazon, Apple, and Google.

              Facebook Changed How We Keep in Touch</h2>
            <p class="card-text"> Facebook made the world smaller, and it's the most obvious, yet arguably the most important element of Facebook's early legacy. Whether you're chatting with old college friends abroad, or messaging your roommate from down the hall, Facebook has solidified itself as an important tool for staying in touch with those you love, as well as those you met briefly. One often-ignored part of the service: Facebook has always been free. Yes, users "pay" by sharing their personal information with the company and agreeing to ads, but financially, having a Facebook account has never costed users a dime. It was because the service is free that Facebook was able to collect more than 1 billion users, and it is because of this rich user base that people continue to use the service. "Socializing the people around the world when they're online was something we hadn't had before," says Brian Blau, research director for consumer technology at Gartner. "Yes, Myspace was popular, but not in the way that Facebook is. Getting more than a billion people to do something at the same time on a regular basis is a task that virtually no other company has ever achieved. </p>

            Facebook Changed the Way We Share Our Lives
            </h2>
            <p class="card-text"> Facebook is no longer the only social network that helps us share our lives, but it definitely got the ball rolling. Your photos, your thoughts, your favorite videos, movies, and books — what used to be personal is now plastered on your social profile, and almost everyone is guilty of oversharing at one point or another. While we've been sharing online for years, it's getting easier and easier. With miniature computers and high-quality cameras in almost everybody's pocket, the ability to share is always there — and Facebook has long-provided an outlet for people to lay bare. In 2013, Facebook users shared approximately 41,000 posts per second, according to online-advertising company Qmee — that's more than 2.4 million posts every minute. To some, like Greylock partner and a former Facebook employee Josh Elman, the practice of social sharing is more than just a fad. "Because of Facebook," he says, "sharing is now a human instinct. </p>

            Facebook Changed the Way We Consume Content
            </h2>
            <p class="card-text"> You can’t change the way people share if you don’t also change the way they consume. Facebook users don’t just post about their personal lives; they also post news and content that are important to them. Political news, sports scores, funny videos — on Facebook, it’s all fair game. It starts with News Feed, a never-ending stream of content from the people and companies that you’ve connected with on the platform. News Feed never ends; in theory, users could scroll on forever, a feature that was unheard of when News Feed debuted in 2006. It’s since been adopted by most social sites, including Twitter, Pinterest and LinkedIn. News Feed is not without faults, of course. Its algorithm is always changing, and because posts don’t always appear in chronological order, it can be tough to keep news and events organized as they come across your screen. Facebook is still working on the best way to surface ads in News Feed, and that means providing relevant ads to each user. </p>
