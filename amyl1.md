Interest of content: very good
I really liked the reddit page that had a reddit feed built into it. It was much more interesting to read than some of the other pages.
I thought it was really good how you analysed multiple uses of the same website, to show the wider contribution to society than you would initially think of.
The history of the websites was interesting but they didn't really add to the 'contribution to society' theme.
On certain pages, it felt like blocks of information had been copied in from other websites. 
It would have been more interesting to include information about what the company does (other than the obvious uses e.g. Facebook owning other companies) rather than the history of the company. I think this would give a better represetation of the contribution to society.

Consistency and quality of visual presentation: excellent
The website looks very professional, and I really liked the images displayed behind the page summaries.
The fact that the navbar stuck to the top of the window made navigation really easy.
It would have also been useful for the Navbar to link between all the pages, so you don't have to go back to the index page to go to the next section.
The website worked really well on a variety of window sizes, which was a really good feature.
Although there was a lot of interesting information on the pages, it was hard to read in the large chuncks of text.
Separating the information into boxes was a great idea to separate the text.
Some images would have been useful to add some interest to the page.

Quality of written presentation: exemplary
On the whole, the content is really good but I did spot a few minor grammatical errors.

Validity of HTML: exemplary
Generally, the HTML code is really well formatted, making it easy to read and understand.
The comments made it easy to understand which section of code related to which which part of the webpage.
I was unable to find any issues with the HTML and it seems to be working well when you are actually using the website.

Evidence of collaboration: outstanding
All the pages had been finished in plenty of time, and to a high quality.
The homepage had been contributed to by all of the team members showing a high level of collaboration.
Several of the pages had only one contributor (reddit,facebook,youtube)
